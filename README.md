# LOLAbilities
Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS using the Riot API and DataDragon assets.

This website takes in a summoner name and displays the abilities for the champions in that game. 
Useful for learning what abilties do and their scalings and cooldowns.

Due to limitiations in the Riot API, tooltips are not complete and there are many missing values. To solve this, I'm going to scrape data from the League of Legends Fandom page to give more detailed information in *advanced* mode.
